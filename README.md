# Feynn Labs Internship Experience: Machine Learning [2023]

This portfolio encapsulates the projects and tasks I undertook during my enriching internship experience with Feynn Labs.

**Role:** Machine Learning Intern  
**Mode:** Virtual

## Project Highlights

### AI Product/Service Ideation: A Lifesaving Application

In a standalone project titled "Artificial Intelligence for Weather Prediction," I proposed the development of an AI-driven application accessible through Android or web platforms. This groundbreaking service aims to accurately predict weather patterns, a crucial tool for public safety and efficient planning in sectors like agriculture, tourism, and disaster management.

### Market Segmentation Study: Theory Meets Practice

Collaborating with a team of four, we delved into the intricacies of Market Segmentation (MS). Our exploration highlighted key theoretical concepts and practical applications, with Python as our tool of choice.

### Electric Vehicle Market: A Segmentation Analysis

In our second project, my team and I were tasked with analyzing the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market through the lens of Market Segmentation. Our objective was to devise a viable strategy for market entry, targeting Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, and Behavioral segments.

### Resume Parsing System
Resumes are the cornerstone of the hiring process, providing a wealth of information about a candidate's skills, experiences, and qualifications. However, manually reviewing each resume can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To streamline this process, we developed a Machine Learning model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to parse and analyze resumes automatically.
